    {Linux Fake Webcam} % Category
    {Wrote a multi-thousand line program in C to which allows the user to pretend they are someone else on any webcam chat. The program does this by inputing a video of someone performing a set of actions and as well as a JSON file with timestamps to the actions and transition between them. It provides the user with an interface they can use to smoothly and convincingly control the actions that appear on their webcam. It does this by using linux video libraries and a kernel module to allow piping video into the webcam device.} % Skills
